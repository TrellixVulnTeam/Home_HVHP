Expenses by category over time 


Questions: 

- Can I purchase this thing and still be within budget? 
- How much would it increase our expenses to make [x] transaction? ('What if' scenario)
Comparing prices of goods (one store from another): 
  Ex: Aldi vs Walmart - what items are cheaper? 
- Do we need to collect any additional data for learning purposes? 
  Ex: collecting size/amounts for equal items to compare prices


What if we built a model that could classify the category based on location, description, price?
