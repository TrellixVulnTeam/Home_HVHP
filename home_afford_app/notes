Goal: 



Deliverable: 

1. Mel wants to be able to take the output from down payment (dp) amount from bottom section
  then spit out the date in the top section of when we would have the dp amount. 

2. Mel wants to plot a vertical line on the graph at the point where dp occurs
  and maybe this line can have a hover feature? 

3. Mel wants a function where user can input existing savings, expenses, and income 
  

It would be nice to have (wish list):
